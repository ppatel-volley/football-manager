### 6.3 Enhanced Command Implementation
```typescript
class EnhancedPOCControlSystem {
  private matchEngine: EnhancedMatchEngine;
  private goalkeeperController: FIFALaw12GoalkeeperController;
  private formationEngine: FormationEngine;

  public handleAttackCommand(): void {
    // Advanced attacking formation with goalkeeper distribution focus
    this.matchEngine.setTacticalStyle('ATTACKING');
    this.formationEngine.transitionToPhase('ATTACK');
    this.goalkeeperController.setDistributionPreference('LONG');
  }

  public handleDefendCommand(): void {
    // Organized defensive formation with goalkeeper leadership
    this.matchEngine.setTacticalStyle('DEFENDING');
    this.formationEngine.transitionToPhase('DEFEND');
    this.goalkeeperController.organiseDefensiveLine();
  }

  public handleGoalkeeperQuickThrow(): void {
    // FIFA-compliant quick distribution
    const goalkeeper = this.matchEngine.getGoalkeeper();
    if (this.goalkeeperController.canExecuteQuickDistribution(goalkeeper)) {
      this.goalkeeperController.executeDistribution(goalkeeper, 'THROW_SHORT');
    }
  }

  public handleTestGoalKick(): void {
    // Trigger goal kick scenario for FIFA compliance testing
    this.matchEngine.transitionToGoalKick();
    this.goalKickController.initializeGoalKickScenario();
