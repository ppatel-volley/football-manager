## 3. POC Scope and Functional Requirements

### 3.0 POC Scope Definition

#### 3.0.1 In-Scope for POC
- **Ball Physics**: Ball in/out detection on all four boundaries
- **Basic Restarts**: Throw-ins, corner kicks, goal kicks based on last touch and line crossed
- **Goals**: Ball completely crossing goal line with proper detection
- **Half-time**: Automatic transition with team switching and formation reset
- **Minimal Stats**: Possession percentage, shots taken, corners awarded
- **Simple 2D Physics**: Canvas 2D with basic friction, no Z-axis or height simulation
- **Minimal HUD**: Essential match information only (score, time, basic stats)
- **AI vs AI**: Autonomous team behaviour for evaluation purposes

#### 3.0.2 Out-of-Scope for POC
- **Voice Commands**: Deferred to Phase 2
- **Offside Detection**: Complex rule implementation deferred
- **Foul System**: Cards, free kicks, penalties deferred
- **Substitution System**: Player changes during match deferred
- **Replay System**: Match playback functionality deferred
- **Commentary/Audio**: Sound effects and match commentary deferred
- **Adaptive/Learning AI**: Advanced AI behaviour deferred
- **Multiplayer**: Real-time multiplayer functionality deferred

#### 3.0.3 Goal Kick Implementation

**Rule Implementation**: When a goal kick occurs, the referee only allows the game to commence once all opposing players have attempted to exit the penalty area, as per FIFA Laws of the Game.

**POC Behaviour**:
- Ball is placed within the defending team's goal area (6-yard box)
- All opposing players must move outside the penalty area before the kick can be taken
- If any opposing player remains in the penalty area, they must attempt to leave
- Ball becomes in play once kicked and clearly moves
- Quick goal kicks allowed if opposing players are actively leaving the penalty area

#### 3.0.4 Goalkeeper Ball Handling

**Goalkeeper Possession Types**:
- **At Feet**: Goalkeeper controls ball on ground, can dribble within penalty area
- **In Hands**: Goalkeeper catches/picks up ball, has 6 seconds to release (FIFA Law 12)

**Goalkeeper Distribution Methods**:
- **Drop Kick**: Goalkeeper drops ball and kicks it long (typically 40-60 yards)
- **Throw**: Short distribution by hand to nearby teammate (typically 10-20 yards)
- **Roll**: Ground distribution to feet of nearby teammate
- **Punt**: Direct kick from hands for maximum distance

**FIFA Law 12 Restrictions**:
- **Pass-back Rule**: Goalkeeper cannot handle ball directly from deliberate pass by teammate's foot
- **6-Second Rule**: Goalkeeper must release ball within 6 seconds when held in hands
- **Handling Area**: Goalkeeper may only handle ball within own penalty area
- **Protection Rule**: Outfield players cannot tackle or dispossess goalkeeper when ball is in hands (only when ball is at feet)

**Modern Goalkeeper Roles**:
- **Sweeper-Keeper**: Modern goalkeepers act as auxiliary defenders, rushing out to intercept through balls
- **Distribution Specialist**: Quick, accurate distribution initiates counter-attacks and maintains possession
- **Command Area**: Goalkeeper commands penalty area, directing defensive positioning

**Tactical Impact**:
- **Opposing Team Response**: When goalkeeper gains possession (especially in hands), opposing players retreat toward own half to defend potential counter-attack
- **Distribution Speed**: Quick distribution (throw/roll) maintains attacking momentum, long distribution (drop kick/punt) creates counter-attack opportunities
- **Defensive Leadership**: Goalkeeper organises defensive line and communicates tactical adjustments

### 3.1 FIFA-Compliant Pitch System

#### 3.1.1 Official FIFA Pitch Standards

Super Soccer Manager: Pro Edition implements FIFA-compliant pitch markings to ensure authentic football simulation. All dimensions are based on FIFA Laws of the Game for professional football.

- **Height**: 2.44 metres (8 feet) 
- **Post Width**: Maximum 12 centimetres (5 inches)

**Penalty Area (18-yard box)**:
- **Depth**: 16.5 metres (18 yards from goal line)
- **Width**: 40.32 metres (44 yards total width)

**Goal Area (6-yard box)**:
- **Depth**: 5.5 metres (6 yards from goal line)
- **Width**: 18.32 metres (20 yards total width)

- **Corner Arc**: 1 metre radius (1 yard)

**Spot Positioning**:
- **Penalty Spot**: 11 metres from goal line (12 yards)
- **Center Spot**: Pitch center for kick-off

#### 3.1.2 Visual Implementation Standards

**Proportional Accuracy**: All pitch markings maintain accurate proportions regardless of screen size or resolution, ensuring consistent gameplay experience across devices.

**Quality Standards**:
- Line markings use FIFA-compliant white colour (#FFFFFF)
- Consistent line width throughout all markings
- Accurate measurement ratios maintained at all zoom levels
- Smooth rendering of curved elements (circles, arcs)

**Formation Editor Tool Integration**: The Formation Editor Tool uses identical FIFA specifications, ensuring formations designed in the editor translate accurately to match simulation.

### 3.2 Formation System (Phase 2)

**Future Implementation**: A developer-only Formation Editor Tool will be delivered in Phase 2 to enable sophisticated tactical AI positioning. See `docs/FET-TDD.md` for complete technical specifications.

**POC Approach**: Use pre-defined formation templates (4-4-2, 4-3-3) with basic positioning rules.

**Opposition Mirroring (Editor Visualisation)**:
- The editor supports a Ghost Opposition view that reflects the user's formation to the other half for tactical preview.
- Mirroring uses the halfway line: positions map as y' = 1 − y (x unchanged).
- The opposition's ball cell is the mirror of the user's: (c, r) → (c, rows − 1 − r).
- Ghost positions are taken from the user's mapping at that mirrored ball cell, then mirrored across the halfway line.
- Ghost is view-only; the user's team remains editable and layered above.

- **Long Passing**: Switching play across the field or finding teammates in distant positions. Requires power, accuracy, and vision to spot distant targets. Technical execution involves 30-degree approach angle and maintaining focus on ball throughout contact
- **Wall Pass (Give-and-Go)**: Breaking through defensive lines using quick combination play. Requires precise timing, immediate movement after passing, and understanding of teammate's runs
- **Through Pass**: Creating direct goal-scoring opportunities by exploiting defensive gaps. Ball played into space between or behind defenders. Requires exceptional vision, timing, and understanding of offside positioning
- **Cross-field Pass**: Long-range passes to switch the point of attack, typically used by defenders and central midfielders to change the tempo and direction of play

**Dribbling Abilities**:
- **Basic Step-Over**: Throw foot over ball to feint direction, then push ball with outside of other foot. Effective in 1v1 encounters for creating initial space
- **Simple Cut (Inside/Outside)**: Sharp directional change using inside or outside of foot. High success rate for creating space against pressing defenders
- **Body Feint**: Drop shoulder and lean to suggest direction before going opposite way. Effective in wing play and creating shooting angles
- **Nutmeg**: Push ball through opponent's legs and accelerate past them. High psychological impact but requires perfect timing
- **Cruyff Turn**: Fake pass/shot, drag ball behind standing leg with inside of foot, turn 180°. Excellent for escaping pressure and changing play direction
- **Stop and Go**: Sudden deceleration followed by explosive acceleration. Highly effective for breaking defensive lines
- **Marseille Turn/Roulette**: Drag ball back with sole, spin 360° whilst shielding, emerge with ball. Very high difficulty technique for central midfield pressure situations
- **Elastico/Flip Flap**: Touch ball outside with outside of foot, immediately snap inside with same foot. Extremely high difficulty technique for creating unpredictable wing play

**Header Abilities**:
- **Standing Header**: Ground-based execution with minimal vertical movement, relies on timing and head positioning. Used for quick redirections and close-range situations
- **Jumping Header**: Most common type requiring elevation and timing, combines vertical leap with precise head contact. Essential for competing in aerial duels
- **Diving Header**: Dynamic technique requiring full body commitment, used when ball is at lower height. High risk but potentially high reward execution

- **Attacking Headers**: Converting crosses and corner kicks into goal-scoring opportunities. Requires accuracy and positioning
- **Flick Headers**: Subtle redirections to teammates, changing ball trajectory for tactical advantage

**Tackling Abilities**:
- **Standing Tackle**: Defender remains on feet throughout challenge, using either foot to dispossess opponent. Low risk technique allowing quick recovery and continued pressure
- **Sliding Tackle**: Most spectacular form involving sliding along ground with leg extended to hit ball away. High success rate when executed properly but significant risk if mistimed
- **Block Tackle**: Uses body positioning to obstruct ball movement, placing body between opponent and ball. Lower risk technique that maintains defensive positioning
- **Interception**: Reading play to cut out passes before they reach intended target. Requires anticipation and positioning rather than direct challenge
- **Shoulder Charge**: Legal physical challenge using shoulder-to-shoulder contact to dispossess opponent while both players are competing for ball
- **Recovery Tackle**: Last-ditch defensive action to prevent goal-scoring opportunity, often involving desperate lunges or blocks

### 3.3 Voice Command System (Out of Scope for POC)
